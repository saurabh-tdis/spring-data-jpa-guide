## Lesson 01: Overall understanding of JPA

Why should you relearn "Spring Data JPA"? As the saying goes: "The future is already here, it's just not popular yet." Looking at the ORM frameworks on the market, MyBatis is known for its flexibility, but it has to maintain complex configurations, and it is not Spring's official natural family bucket, so it has to do additional work. Configuration work, if a senior architect has to do a lot of encapsulation; Hibernate is famous for HQL and relational mapping, but it is not particularly flexible to use; then Spring Data JPA is coming, and it feels like it will seize the JPA dominance of ORM, and the bottom layer is Hibernate provides a super flexible interface for encapsulation, and is very consistent with the object-oriented and Rest styles. It feels like a blessing to architects and developers, and the combination of Spring Data JPA and Spring Boot has natural advantages. You will It is found that more and more companies have traditional SSH, Spring, MyBatis requirements for recruitment, gradually changing to Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Spring Data and other Spring family bucket requirements, and many new generation architects are based on them. Ecological considerations are gradually promoting more usage scenarios of Spring Data JPA.    

In this chapter, we will first take a general look at Spring Data JPA from the overall to the details.

### Comparison of ORM frameworks on the market

- MyBatis: MyBatis was originally an open source project iBatis of Apache. In 2010, the project was moved from Apache Software Foundation to Google Code and renamed MyBatis. It focuses on the mapping relationship between POJO and SQL, and can perform more detailed SQL. It is very flexible to use, easy to use and easy to master, so it is deeply loved by developers. It currently has the highest market share and is more suitable for API scenarios of Internet application companies. The disadvantage is that the workload is relatively large, and various configuration files and SQL statements are required.
- Hibernate: Hibernate is an open source object-relational mapping framework. It provides a very lightweight object encapsulation for JDBC, allowing Java programmers to use object programming thinking to manipulate the database at will. Objects have their own life cycle, focusing on the relationship between objects, and have their own HQL query language, so the database is very portable. Hibernate is a complete ORM framework that complies with the JPA specification and has its own caching mechanism. It is difficult to get started and is more suitable for enterprise-level application system development.
- Spring Data JPA: It can be understood as a re-encapsulation and abstraction of the JPA specification. The underlying layer still uses Hibernate's JPA technology implementation and quotes the JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) query language. It is part of the entire Spring ecosystem. Due to the popularity of Spring Boot and Spring Cloud in the market, Spring Data JPA has gradually entered everyone's field of vision. They are an organic whole, easy to use, and speed up the development efficiency. Developers do not need to care about and configure more things, and can be completely immersed in the implementation of Spring's complete ecological standards. It is easy to get started, has high development efficiency, and has good support for objects and great flexibility. The market recognition is getting higher and higher.
- OpenJPA: It is an open source project provided by the Apache organization. It implements the JPA standard in EJB 3.0 and provides developers with a powerful and easy-to-use persistent data management framework. However, its functionality, performance, and popularity need to be further improved, so not many people use it.
- QueryDSL: QueryDSL can build queries in a universal API manner on any supported ORM framework or SQL platform. Currently, the platforms supported by QueryDSL include JPA, JDO, SQL, Java Collections, RDF, Lucene, and Hibernate Search. At the same time, Spring Data JPA also provides good support for QueryDSL.

### Introduction to JPA and which open source implementations are available

JPA (Java Persistence API) is the Chinese name of Java Persistence Layer API. It is JDK 5.0 annotation or XML that describes the mapping relationship between object-relationship tables and persists the entity objects at runtime to the database.
   
Sun introduced the new JPA ORM specification for two reasons: first, to simplify the development of existing Java EE and Java SE applications; second, Sun hopes to integrate ORM technologies and achieve unification.   
  
#### JPA includes the following three aspects

- A set of API standards, under the javax.persistence package, is used to operate entity objects and perform CRUD operations. The framework completes everything for us in the background, freeing developers from tedious JDBC and SQL codes.
- Object-oriented query language: Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL), which is a very important aspect of persistence operations. It queries data through object-oriented rather than database-oriented query languages ​​to avoid tight coupling of program SQL statements.
- ORM (Object/Relational Metadata) metadata mapping, JPA supports two forms of metadata: XML and JDK 5.0 annotations. The metadata describes the mapping relationship between objects and tables, and the framework persists entity objects to database tables based on this.     

#### Open source implementations of JPA

The purpose of JPA is to provide persistence standards for POJO. It can be seen that after several years of practical exploration, the concept of being able to run independently without containers and facilitate development and testing has been deeply rooted in people's minds. Hibernate 3.2+, TopLink 10.1.3, OpenJPA, QueryDSL all provide JPA implementations, and the last Spring integration Spring Data JPA. Currently, Internet companies and traditional companies use JPA development standards on a large scale.

### Learn about Spring Data

#### Introduction to Spring Data 

The Spring Data project was developed in 2010. From the beginning, Spring Data wanted to provide a familiar, consistent, Spring-based data access programming model while still retaining the special features of the underlying data storage. It can easily allow developers to use data access technologies including: relational databases, non-relational databases (NoSQL) and cloud-based data services. 
  
Spring Data Common is the common part of all Spring Data modules. This project provides shared infrastructure across Spring Data projects. It includes technology-neutral library interfaces and a metadata model that adheres to Java classes.  
  
Spring Data not only provides good support, extension, abstraction, and convenient APIs for traditional database access technologies: JDBC, Hibernate, JDO, TopLick, JPA, and MyBatis, but also provides good support for non-relational data such as NoSQL: MongoDB, Redis, Apache Solr, etc. 
   
#### What are the sub-projects of Spring Data?

Main Modules:    

- Spring Data Commons
- Spring Data Gemfire
- Spring Data JPA
- Spring Data KeyValue
- Spring Data LDAP

#### Main features of Spring Data operations

The Spring Data project aims to provide a common coding model. The data access object realizes the abstraction of the physical data layer and facilitates the writing of query methods. Through object mapping, the conversion between domain objects and persistent storage is realized, and the template provides access to the underlying storage entity. The operation has the following main features:

- Provides template operations such as Spring Data Redis and Spring Data Riak;
- Powerful Repository and abstract mapping of customized data storage objects;
- Support for data access objects (Auting, etc.).

#### Spring Data JPA main classes and structure diagram

##### Classes we need to master and use

Seven major Repository interfaces:

- Repository（org.springframework.data.repository）；
- CrudRepository（org.springframework.data.repository）；
- PagingAndSortingRepository（org.springframework.data.repository）；
- JpaRepository（org.springframework.data.jpa.repository）；
- QueryByExampleExecutor（org.springframework.data.repository.query）；
- JpaSpecificationExecutor（org.springframework.data.jpa.repository）；
- QueryDslPredicateExecutor（org.springframework.data.querydsl）。

Two major Repository implementation classes:

- SimpleJpaRepository（org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.support）；
- QueryDslJpaRepository（org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.support）。

##### The class structure diagram is shown in the figure

![enter image description here](http://images.gitbook.cn/bbc3ba10-252e-11e8-a332-931f85438b0b)

Basically, the above are the classes and interfaces we need to care about. First, have a general idea of ​​them, and then we will explain them one by one in the following chapters.

##### Classes that need to be understood, the real underlying encapsulation class of JPA

- EntityManager（javax.persistence）；
- EntityManagerImpl（org.hibernate.jpa.internal）。

### MySQL Quick Start Example

Take Spring Boot 2.0 and Spring JDBC as the technical scenario, and choose MySQL as an example.

Environmental requirements:

- JDK 1.8 
- Maven 3.0+
- IntelliJ IDEA

#### Step 1: Create a database and create a user table

1）Create a new user with data and attach permissions

```
mysql> create database db_example;
mysql> create user 'springuser'@'localhost' identified by 'ThePassword';
mysql> grant all on db_example.* to 'springuser'@'localhost'; 
```

2）Create a table

```
CREATE TABLE `user` (  
`id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,  
`name` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,  
`email` varchar(200) DEFAULT NULL,  
PRIMARY KEY (`id`))
```

#### Step 2: Create Example1 using Intellij IDEA

![enter image description here](http://images.gitbook.cn/dcd85ad0-252e-11e8-92db-817ab3b7ffb7)  

The above information is what is needed in Maven's pom and can be modified.
   
![enter image description here](http://images.gitbook.cn/9bf140d0-252f-11e8-a332-931f85438b0b) 

Select JPA, MySQL and Web and click Next. Then you will get a project with the following structure: 
   
![enter image description here](http://images.gitbook.cn/12e0a410-2530-11e8-a863-110ad122986d)

#### Step 3: Create or modify the application.properties file

The content of src/main/resources/application.properties under the sources of the project is as follows:

```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/db_example
spring.datasource.username=springuser
spring.datasource.password=ThePassword
```

#### Step 4: Create an @Entity

src/main/java/example/example1/User.java：

```
package com.example.example1;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.GenerationType;
import javax.persistence.Id;
@Entity 
public class User {
   @Id
   @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO)
   private Long id;
   private String name;
   private String email;
   public Long getId() {
      return id;
   }
   public void setId(Long id) {
      this.id = id;
   }
   public String getName() {
      return name;
   }
   public void setName(String name) {
      this.name = name;
   }
   public String getEmail() {
      return email;
   }
   public void setEmail(String email) {
      this.email = email;
   }
}
```

#### Step 5: Create a Repository

src/main/java/example/example1/UserRepository.java：

```
package com.example.example1;
import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository;
public interface UserRepository extends CrudRepository<User, Long> {
}
```

#### Step 6: Create a controller

```
package com.example.example1;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ResponseBody;
@Controller
@RequestMapping(path = "/demo")
public class UserController {
   @Autowired
   private UserRepository userRepository;
   @GetMapping(path = "/add")
   public void addNewUser(@RequestParam String name, @RequestParam String email) {
      User n = new User();
      n.setName(name);
      n.setEmail(email);
      userRepository.save(n);
   }
   @GetMapping(path = "/all")
   @ResponseBody
   public Iterable<User> getAllUsers() {
      return userRepository.findAll();
   }
}
```

#### Step 7: Run the main() function of Example1Application directly

Open Example1Application and the content is as follows:

```
package com.example.example1;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
@SpringBootApplication
public class Example1Application {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      SpringApplication.run(Example1Application.class, args);
   }
}
```

The URL to access is as follows:

```
$ curl 'localhost:8080/demo/add?name=First&email=someemail@someemailprovider.com'
$ curl 'localhost:8080/demo/all'
```

The effect can already be seen at this time.
